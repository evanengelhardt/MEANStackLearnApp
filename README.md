# MEANStackLearnApp

This a MEAN Stack website application. It utilizes the MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js technologies.

It was made by following a youtube tutorial from Traversy Media.

It's purpose was to learn how to build a fullstack web application because I had no previous experience in any of the technologies other than Angular.
